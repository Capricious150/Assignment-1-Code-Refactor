### To Run:

Final page available at this URL: 
CSS was formatted for a Laptop display at 1366 x 768px Resolution, but should format correctly in 1920 x 1080px. Will not format correctly on mobile devices. 

### Code Refactor: 

##### Minor adjustments were made to originally submitted Index.html - 
    ..* Alt Tags were added to all images in Index.html.
    ..* Several existing Div containers were replaced with more appropriate semantic elements
    ..* Page Title was updated
    ..* Several Classes were updated to match refactored style.css
    ..* Added missing link for Search Engine Optimization anchor tag; fixed Nav Bar usage

##### Major adjustments were made in style.css, located in the assets folder of the repo - 
    ..* Multiple existing Classes were not in use in Index.HTML, and were removed.
    ..* Consolidated "Search-Engine-Optimization" "Online Reputation Management" and "Social Media Marketing" classes into class "ContentMain"
    ..* Set Footer visibility to "Hidden" to match Mock-up image while retaining SEO elements
    ..* Added extensive comments
    ..* Enabled Class "content" (was previously commented-out) to fix side-bar
    ..* Adjusted size and margins on side-bar images to fit, and appear centered (note: fragile! These are fixed with pixel-based measurements and may become misaligned depending on end-user screen resolution)
    ..* Made several small corrections to text color and font spacing to better match Mock-Up image
